# Random-ball
description:The HTML structure is established with a container styled to hold bouncing balls, outlined by a border.
JavaScript defines variables and functions for generating and moving balls, each with random colors, positions, and velocities.
The ballCount(n) function creates a specified number of balls, setting their initial properties and appending them to the container.
The moveBall() function manages the animation, updating ball positions and simulating bouncing effects using basic gravity-like behavior.
Ball positions and velocities are adjusted to create the bouncing effect within the container.
The setTimeout function is employed to continuously update the ball positions and achieve smooth bouncing animation.
Finally, the ballCount(10) function call initializes the animation with 10 randomly generated balls within the defined container.
